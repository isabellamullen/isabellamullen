Hello! I'm Isabella Mullen. I am currently a master's student in Computational Social Science at UC San Diego.

I am currently developing a novel approach for ideal-point estimation in political science using deep neural networks. This project used neural networks and deep learning to combine non-tabular and tabular data sources, applying normalizing flow models to map political positions into a low-dimensional latent space, enhancing precision and insight into political discourse analysis.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to any project here. Your feedback and collaboration are always welcome!
